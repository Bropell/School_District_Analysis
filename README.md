# School_District_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use the power of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from many schools within a district. The data must be aggregated in order to analyze the trends in school performance in math and reading. Based off this data, the school board can make better decisions regarding budget allotments. For the challenge specifically, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty within the math and reading grades from Thomas High School nith graders. Their math and reading scores are to be removed from the data and the school district analysis must be repeated in order to see how the changes affected the overall analysis.
